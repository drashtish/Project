A Library Management System is an essential tool for efficiently managing library resources, including books, users, and borrowing processes. The system automates key functions such as cataloging books, tracking user activity, and managing book loans and returns. By providing a centralized platform, an LMS facilitates better organization and access to information, ultimately improving the efficiency of library operations and enhancing the user experience.
